# Build ML Pipeline

Declare a skrub DataOps graph, then attach the locked splitter
and any non-default score. Smoke is the last step here. Do not
fit, tune, persist, or call `skore.evaluate`.

## Human-facing prose

Details: `setup-workspace` `references/human_facing_prose.md`.
Experiment markdown, design-note Method text, and `#` comments
describe this pipeline. `<!-- results-embed: … -->` is a site
marker. Authoring hints stay in this skill.

**X marker** is `.skb.mark_as_X()`. **Predict grid** is the rows
to score. **Cross-row step** reads other rows (lag, rolling,
group-agg, side join). **Layers 1 / 2 / 3** are sources, the
grid plus marker, and features after the marker.

## Procedure

1. `python -m skore_skills status`. Missing scaffold → S0. Then
   `python -m skore_skills design consent --stem <stem>`. JSON
   `action` is authoritative. `ask` / `stop` → do not declare
   ("build it" is not approval). `proceed` continues. Then
   `python -m skore_skills frame show` without `--revise`.
   Anything other than `proceed` loads `frame-ml-problem` and
   stops.
2. Emit 1–3 sentences before the first write: this is local
   preparation of an unfitted `build_learner`, Method cells, and
   a pipeline snapshot, then smoke. It does not train or run
   full-dataset evaluation. Do not invent a duration. Say it
   once. If approval is pending, preview only.
3. Emit Pre-flight. Tick a box only with evidence from this turn.
4. Declare `build_learner` (Rule 1–3). Sources, features, and
   the estimator first. Then attach `cv` and any non-default
   score from `translation`, still before
   `.skb.make_learner()`. `python -m skore_skills api get` for
   every new symbol. `python -m skore_skills style` after edits.
   Probes go to `scratch/` via the composed-dev Python from
   `env verify`. No inline `python -c`. No warning filters
   unless the user asks.
5. Unfitted snapshot: `references/snapshot.md`.
6. When `experiments/NN_*.py` exists for this stem, load
   `smoke-test-ml-pipeline` only if that skill is installed.
   Missing skill → one line; do not invent the pytest file.
   Then `python -m skore_skills smoke run --stem <stem>`. JSON
   `stop` / `red` / `smoke_missing` → fix the graph here. Do
   not loosen the assertion. Do not evaluate. Do not claim
   pytest is green without this command.
7. On `smoke run` `proceed`, the checkpoint below, then
   `python -m skore_skills evaluate consent --stem <stem>`.
   - `ask` — quote JSON `context` (`question`, `experiment`,
     `smoke`, `persisted_report`) in 2–4 lines: what the answer
     authorizes, the design question, and that this stem has no
     persisted report yet. Then **AskUserQuestion**, Evaluate
     (Recommended) / Modify / Stop, and stop. Do not write
     `skore.evaluate`. **Modify** → edit, then `smoke run`
     again. **Stop** → end.
   - `proceed` — a report already exists. Load
     `evaluate-ml-pipeline` if installed, or return to
     `model-ml-pipeline` when that skill called this one.
   - `stop` — smoke file missing. Do not evaluate.
   If the user answers **Evaluate**, load
   `evaluate-ml-pipeline` when installed. `smoke run`
   `proceed` is not that answer.

### Checkpoint

After `smoke run` `proceed`, before the Evaluate menu. 2–6
sentences: what was declared, that smoke is green, the learner.
Ground them in Method. Do not invent a metric. No locator yet.

Then links. When `site build` ran this turn:
`[report.html](<workspace>/report.html)` and
`html/<stem>.html`. Otherwise
`[journal/<stem>.md](journal/<stem>.md)` and
`[experiments/<stem>.py](experiments/<stem>.py)`.

## Entry contracts

Implement the approved design. Do not silently upgrade it.

- **Locked baseline** — the estimator the journal baseline token
  names. `dummy` is `DummyClassifier` / `DummyRegressor` in the
  normal DataOps graph; it checks that the path runs.
  `logistic`, `seasonal_naive`, `group_mean`, and `production`
  are that comparison model. `api get` the class.
- **EDA-backed** — only Method-cited findings. A missing choice
  stops for a question. A temporal finding is the locked `cv`,
  not a license for three layers, lags, or `AlignXy` unless
  Method names those steps.
- **Backlog / discussion** — Method is the boundary.

On a feature, transform, or leakage question, load
`research-ml-practice` if it is installed. Abstract the problem
class. AskUserQuestion `allow_multiple` on `declare` rows that
do not violate a stop. `measure` revisits EDA and does not edit
`data_analysis.py`. The splitter still comes from `frame show`.
`evaluate` names `evaluate-ml-pipeline`. `confirm` asks the
user. Missing skill → one line.

## Rule 1 — Skrub DataOps is the pipeline entry point

Root at `skrub.var(...)`, not a bare `sklearn.Pipeline`.
`skrub.X` / `skrub.y` are not roots (S4). If the user asks for
`sklearn.Pipeline` or `build_pipeline()`, do not import
`Pipeline`, even as an inner estimator. Redirect to `skrub.var`
and `build_learner` returning `predictions.skb.make_learner()`.
Do not illustrate the refusal with a `Pipeline([...])`
constructor.

```python
import skrub
from sklearn.ensemble import HistGradientBoostingRegressor

from <pkg>.data import TARGET_COL, load_raw


def build_learner(data_dir_preview=None):
    """Return the unfit learner (skrub SkrubLearner)."""
    data_dir = (
        skrub.var("data_dir", value=str(data_dir_preview))
        if data_dir_preview is not None
        else skrub.var("data_dir")
    )
    data = data_dir.skb.apply_func(load_raw)
    X = data.drop(columns=[TARGET_COL]).skb.mark_as_X()
    y = data[TARGET_COL].skb.mark_as_y()
    predictions = X.skb.apply(
        HistGradientBoostingRegressor(random_state=0), y=y
    )
    return predictions.skb.make_learner()
```

A quick traditional baseline uses `skrub.tabular_pipeline` (or
`TableVectorizer`) plus one task-appropriate estimator. Confirm
both with `api get`. Do not hand-tune columns or search
hyperparameters here. Other shapes:
`references/common_patterns.md`.

## Rule 2 — Mark X early; featurize after

Per-row math and fit-time encoders: marker on the loaded frame.
Any cross-row step: marker upstream of that step. Code for the
three layers, including the loader-baked horizon refusal:
`references/layer_examples.md`. Read it before proposing Layer 2.

`value=` is preview only. Expose `data_dir_preview=None` on
`build_learner`. Do not bake a relative path into `pipeline.py`.

## Splitter and scoring, after the graph

Read `translation` from the `frame show` that returned
`proceed`. Attach on the existing X marker, then
`.skb.make_learner()`. skrub requires `cv=` whenever
`split_kwargs` is set. Integer `cv` is not a splitter. Evaluate
omits `splitter=` so skore reuses this `cv`
(`evaluate-ml-pipeline/references/metadata-routing.md`).

That `cv` copies the locked deployment: a scored fit contains
only rows that deployment would already have seen. The shapes
below are the usual ones. When the deployment is a different
structure, open `references/custom-splitter.md` and write
`split` for that setting.

- `scheme` `date_time` — open the time series section of
  `references/custom-splitter.md`. `cv=` is the project-local
  class that section describes. `split_kwargs` carries the
  timestamp values. The timestamp column is the one the EDA or
  the text shipped with the data already names. Ask which
  column holds the timestamps only when those sources do not
  name one. `time_role` `covariate` keeps that column in the
  features. `sort_key` drops it from the features and still
  passes it in `split_kwargs`.
- `splitter` `GroupKFold` — `cv=GroupKFold(n_splits=<folds>)`
  and `split_kwargs={"groups": data["<translation.groups>"]}`.
- `splitter` `KFold` — `cv=KFold(n_splits=<folds>)` and empty
  `split_kwargs`.
- Holdout (`report` `EstimatorReport`) or `translation` null —
  no `cv`.

Scoring uses `translation.metric`. If that name is one skore
already reports for the task (regression: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R²;
binary: accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC; multiclass:
macro and micro variants; multilabel: per-label and averages),
do not attach a scorer. Otherwise
`.skb.with_scoring(...)` in this same late step. The callable
shape is `evaluate-ml-pipeline/references/custom-metrics.md`.
Do not pass `scoring=` to `skore.evaluate`.

Do not write `skore.evaluate(...)` here. Do not call
`train_test_split` from pipeline code.

## Rule 3 — Attach: stateless function, stateful estimator

- `.skb.apply_func(fn)` — output depends only on the current
  row and constants.
- `.skb.apply(estimator)` — learns on training, reapplies on
  test.
- `skrub.deferred` — rare; only when combining several DataOps
  and no skrub joiner fits. Default is `apply_func`.
  Details: `references/source-binding.md`.

Would the output change on the training subset versus the whole
frame? Yes → `.skb.apply`. Means, medians, quantiles,
vocabularies, target encoding, TF-IDF: stateful.

```
STOP — target encoding / apply_func. When the user asks for
`def target_encode` + `.skb.apply_func`: refuse. Do not paste
the leaky function body and then the fix. Propose sklearn
TargetEncoder (or BaseEstimator + TransformerMixin) via
`.skb.apply`. Name `api get` for the signature.
```

## Reproducibility

`done` History rows stay runnable. Details:
`references/reproducibility_mechanics.md`.

- **Option 1** — a default-preserving flag on the existing
  function. Small append. The default keeps prior callers
  unchanged (`include_calendar_features: bool = False`).
- **Option 2** — a new function called only from the new
  experiment.
- **Option 3** — branch the module. Last resort.

Three or more flags, or a flag that changes an existing
caller's default → Option 2, or stop. After the change, pytest
all of `tests/smoke/`.

## Stops

### S0. Workspace not scaffolded

`status` first. `has_src` and `has_journal` both false → stop.
Do not require `git`. Missing design: `design consent`; `ask` /
`stop` stay here. Missing data contract: explain and stop.

### S1. Missing dependency

`import skrub` / `sklearn` failure, or a DataOp HTML stub, loads
`add-python-package` for `skrub` and `scikit-learn`. Do not
`env add` here. Do not substitute `sklearn.Pipeline`.

### S2. Symbol from memory is forbidden

Every new skrub, sklearn, or skore name comes from `api get` or
a matching cache read this turn.

### S4. `skrub.X` / `skrub.y` are not graph roots

Root on `skrub.var("<source>", value=preview)`. An existing
`skrub.X` graph: show the alternative and ask. Do not
auto-rewrite. Catalogue: `references/source-binding.md`.

```
Refuse: skrub.X / skrub.y are not graph roots (S4).
They bake the marker at the source and defeat Layer 1.

Alternative (refactor — ask before rewriting):
  data = skrub.var("data_dir", value=preview).skb.apply_func(load_raw)
  X = data.drop(columns=[TARGET_COL]).skb.mark_as_X()
  y = data[TARGET_COL].skb.mark_as_y()
```

### S5. Late `mark_as_X` when any feature is cross-row

The marker sits upstream of every cross-row step. Symptom:
`len(predictions) != n_predict_grid_rows`, `feature_steps=[]`,
or a wrapper whose job is to filter NaNs the pipeline produced.
Recovery: `references/layer_examples.md`. Do not loosen smoke.

A loader that computes `y = col.shift(-H)` and then marks X is
S5 and S6. Horizon lives in Layer 2. Do not invent a wrapper
estimator that shifts, `dropna`s, or filters nulls.

### S6. Layer 1 doesn't know the question

Loaders describe what data exists. Horizon, lag, window, and
task filters belong in Layer 2+. If an external consumer could
not derive the step without knowing the task, push it past
Layer 1.

## Pre-flight — emit before any code

```
Pre-flight (build-ml-pipeline):
- [ ] sklearn, skrub, skore import
      Evidence: scratch/<ts>_check_tier1.py. Not inline python -c.
- [ ] api get for new skrub and sklearn symbols this turn
- [ ] Each skrub.var is a source id, not a baked path
- [ ] mark_as_X placement (loaded frame, or predict grid if cross-row)
- [ ] Layer 1 has no horizon, lag, or task filter
- [ ] cv on mark_as_X matches translation
      (date class | GroupKFold | KFold | no cv on holdout)
- [ ] data_dir_preview=None; no path literal in pipeline.py
```

Re-emit it with evidence before the final message.
