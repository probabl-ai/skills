Unless a case says otherwise, `status.modeling_decisions` is `locked`
and `frame show` already returned `proceed` with a non-null
`translation`.

## CASE_01 — Approved model implementation

**User prompt:**
> The baseline design is approved. Implement and test the model.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `status.setup.pending` is empty.
- Matching approved design note and experiment shell exist.
- Workspace is scaffolded (`has_src` and `has_journal` true).

**Must do:**
- Run `python -m skore_skills status`.
- Resume the approved stem directly; do not show the starting
  choices menu.
- Preview the broad sequence as local pipeline preparation, small
  real-data smoke fit/predict, optional full-dataset evaluation,
  then read-only audit; leave each detailed compute preview to
  its child skill and do not invent minute estimates.
- Dispatch `build-ml-pipeline` (do not load
  `smoke-test-ml-pipeline` as a sibling of evaluate).
- Treat smoke as a **step of build** that runs
  `python -m skore_skills smoke run --stem <stem>`.
- Name the post-smoke AskUserQuestion (Evaluate (Recommended) /
  Modify / Stop) before full-dataset evaluation.
- Preserve the matching experiment stem.
- Run `python -m skore_skills git end-turn --stage implement`
  after the implement loop (after Evaluate / Modify / Stop,
  evaluate, audit, and
  record-outcome — not before the Evaluate pick).
- If that command returns `invoke`, load `persist-ml-git`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Duplicate detailed build / smoke / evaluate / audit previews
  from the dispatcher.
- Load `smoke-test-ml-pipeline` as a sibling dispatcher step.
- Write `skore.evaluate` or load `evaluate-ml-pipeline` /
  `audit-ml-pipeline` before the post-smoke Evaluate question.
- Replace skrub DataOps with a bare sklearn Pipeline.
- Mark the experiment done while smoke tests fail.
- Run `git commit` in this skill or `git push`.
- Distill `scratch/research/` here instead of loading
  `build-ml-pipeline`.
- Run `python -m skore_skills model choices` for this explicit,
  already-approved stem.

## CASE_02 — Missing design note stops before code

**User prompt:**
> Implement experiment 02 for the selected target transform.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `status.setup.pending` is empty.
- The Backlog choice is confirmed with stem `02_target_transform`.
- `journal/02_target_transform.md` does not exist.

**Must do:**
- Run `python -m skore_skills scaffold --journal --stem
  02_target_transform` to create the packaged design-note shell.
- State that Question, Motivation, Method, and Risks are filled only
  after that command creates the shell, then stop for user approval.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Write model or experiment code before the design note is approved.
- Recreate or fill the design-note shape from memory when the CLI
  command did not run this turn.
- Run `python -m skore_skills site build` before the shell exists.

## CASE_03 — Site on rebuilds after implement

**User prompt:**

- `status.setup.pending` is empty.
- Matching approved design note and experiment shell exist.
- `policy.site` is true. `policy.notebooks` is false.
- `export-ml-site` is installed.

**Must do:**
- Dispatch `build-ml-pipeline` (`smoke run` inside build).
- Name the post-smoke Evaluate / Modify / Stop question before
  evaluate.
- Run `python -m skore_skills site build` after the unfitted
  Method snapshot (`pipeline/` or `pipeline.html`; before
  Evaluate is fine) so Method shows the DataOp report, and again
  after the implement loop before git end-turn.
- Run `python -m skore_skills git end-turn --stage implement`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Fail the model turn if site build errors; name the error.
- Run `notebook convert` while the notebooks gate is off.
- Run `git commit` in this skill or `git push`.
- Write `skore.evaluate` before the post-smoke Evaluate question.

## CASE_04 — Notebooks on converts the experiment script

**User prompt:**

- Run `python -m skore_skills notebook convert
  experiments/01_baseline.py --html` after the implement loop,
  before site build.
- Also convert `audit/01_baseline.py --html` when that file exists.
  Do not add `<!-- results-embed: audit -->`.
- Run `python -m skore_skills site build` before git end-turn.
- Run `python -m skore_skills git end-turn --stage implement`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Fail the model turn if convert errors; name the error.
- Run `cells run` as a substitute for convert.
- Run `git commit` in this skill or `git push`.
- Write `skore.evaluate` before the post-smoke Evaluate question.

## CASE_05 — Smoke red or Stop does not start evaluate

**User prompt:**
> The baseline design is approved. Implement the model. Pytest
> smoke is red on row count.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `status.setup.pending` is empty.
- Approved design and experiment script exist.
- `tests/smoke/test_01_baseline.py` fails pytest (row count).

**Must do:**
- Stay with `build-ml-pipeline` / `smoke run` to fix topology.
- Name that JSON `stop` keeps the loop in build.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Load `evaluate-ml-pipeline` or write `skore.evaluate`.
  Describing the post-green sequence, and saying it is unreachable
  while smoke is red, is not starting it. Writing the call this
  turn is.
- Load `audit-ml-pipeline`.
- Loosen the smoke assertion so pytest passes.

  ask Review / Skip / Stop. Do not load `audit-ml-pipeline` from
  this dispatcher.
- After Review, load `manage-ml-backlog` in record-outcome mode
  with the returned digest, locator, and G-AUDIT-FINDING.
- Record before `notebook convert` and `site build`.
- Run `python -m skore_skills notebook convert
  experiments/01_baseline.py --html` after record-outcome and
  before site build.
- Convert `audit/01_baseline.py --html` here, after
  record-outcome and before site build, together with the
  experiment script.
- Write 2–6 sentences from the digest, name `report.html` and
  `html/01_baseline.html` instead of the design-note markdown,

- Run `cells run` from this dispatcher before Review.
- Leave History `planned` in any journal excerpt you author.
- Skip `audit/01_baseline.py` because the audit skill was supposed
  to convert it.

  `skore.evaluate`, or because the unfitted-snapshot reference
  forbids `notebook convert`.
- Add `<!-- results-embed: audit -->`.
- Open idea triage inside record-outcome mode.
- Write the journal files directly instead of dispatching.
