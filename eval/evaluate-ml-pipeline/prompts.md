# evaluate-ml-pipeline eval — golden prompts

Unless a case says otherwise, `status.modeling_decisions` is `locked`
and `frame show` returned `proceed` with `translation.splitter`
`KFold`, `n_splits` 5, `groups` null, and `metric` `MAE`.

Behavioural prompts. Pass = every Must do ticked, zero Must NOT
violated.

---

## CASE_01 — Standard skore.evaluate entry, IID tabular

**User prompt:**
> Wire `experiments/01_baseline.py` for the baseline. Tabular
> regression, no groups, no temporal ordering.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `journal/01_baseline.md` approved.
- `src/<pkg>/pipeline.py` exists with `build_learner` returning a
  `SkrubLearner`. The X-marker has `cv=KFold(n_splits=5)` and
  empty `split_kwargs`.
- `python -m skore_skills frame show` returns `proceed` with
  `translation.splitter` `KFold`, `n_splits` 5, `metric` `MAE`.
- `experiments/01_baseline.py` is the scaffold placeholder.
- `policy.skore_mode` is `local`.
- Cache exists at `scratch/api/sklearn/1.8.0/cv_splitters.md`
  covering `KFold` / `GroupKFold`, and at
  `scratch/api/skore/0.18.0/evaluate.md`.

**Must do:**
- After all evaluation gates and before writing/running
  `skore.evaluate`, give a 1–3 sentence preview: local
  full-dataset CV with the selected splitter, report persistence,
  and the `experiments/01_baseline.py` /
  `scratch/results/01_baseline/` outputs.
- Name the fold count when known; otherwise explain that timing
  depends on rows, folds/repeats, and learner cost. Do not invent
  a minute estimate.
- Pick **`skore.evaluate(learner, data={...})`** as the entry
  point, with no `splitter=` (not `cross_val_score`, not
  `cross_validate`). The `KFold` already on the marker is reused.
- Score that one learner with one `skore.evaluate` and one
  `project.put`.
- Name `python -m skore_skills frame show` and
  `python -m skore_skills api get` for `skore.evaluate` (or Read
  the matching caches already listed).
- Mention `data={...}` (env-dict) for `SkrubLearner`, NOT
  positional `X, y`.
- Run `python -m skore_skills git end-turn --stage evaluate` at
  the end of the turn.
- If that command returns `invoke`, load `persist-ml-git`.
- Write `scratch/results/01_baseline/report.html` from
  `report._repr_html_()`, `report.txt` from `repr(report)`, and
  `locator.txt` with the normalized G-REPORT-LOCATOR in
  `experiments/01_baseline.py` after the bare `report` display.
- Overwrite `scratch/results/01_baseline/pipeline.html` from a
  fitted `estimator_` (`reports_[0].estimator_` on a CV report),
  not `SkrubLearner.report`.
- Run `python -m skore_skills loop locator --stem 01_baseline` and
  `python -m skore_skills loop artifacts --stem 01_baseline`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Present splitter reasoning alone as model fitting.
- Recommend `cross_val_score`, `cross_validate`,
  `classification_report`, or hand-rolled `print(mean_squared_error(...))`.
- Default to `StratifiedKFold` (forbidden — compresses across-fold
  variance, even on imbalance).
- Pass `splitter=` to `skore.evaluate`.
- Pre-pin a different metric (e.g. `scoring="neg_mean_squared_error"`).
  The locked comparison is `MAE`.
- Run `git commit` in this skill or `git push`.

---

## CASE_02 — Time series cv is missing on the DataOp

**User prompt:**
> Wire `experiments/02_load_forecast.py` for the 24h-ahead load
> forecast experiment. Pick the splitter.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `journal/02_load_forecast.md` approved.
- `pipeline.py` X-marker has no `cv=`.
- `python -m skore_skills frame show` returns `proceed` with
  `translation.scheme` `date_time`, `n_splits` 4, `gap` 7,
  `gap_unit` `day`.
- Matching smoke pytest is green.

**Must do:**
- Name `python -m skore_skills frame show`.
- Return to `build-ml-pipeline` because the locked date splitter
  is not on the marker. Do not write `skore.evaluate` yet.

**Must NOT do:**
- Write `skore.evaluate` in this turn.
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).

---

## CASE_03 — `split_kwargs={"groups": ...}` → GroupKFold

**User prompt:**
> Wire `experiments/NN_*.py` for a tabular regression where rows
> are grouped by customer.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `status.modeling_decisions` is `locked`.
- `frame show` `translation.groups` is `customer_id` and
  `translation.splitter` is `GroupKFold`.
- `pipeline.py` X-marker has
  `cv=GroupKFold(n_splits=5)` and
  `split_kwargs={"groups": data["customer_id"]}`.
- `python -m skore_skills frame show` returns `proceed` with
  `translation.splitter` `GroupKFold` and `groups` `customer_id`.
- No temporal structure.

**Must do:**
- Name `python -m skore_skills frame show`. Reuse the `GroupKFold`
  already on the marker. Do not withhold that name.
- Call `skore.evaluate(learner, data={...})` **without**
  `splitter=` so skore reuses the DataOp `cv` and `groups`
  (`references/metadata-routing.md`).
- `python -m skore_skills api get` for the *signature* may be named
  as the next live turn. Do not fail if signature lookup is BLOCKED
  as long as `GroupKFold` is named.
- Show the `data={...}` env-dict form for a `SkrubLearner`.
- Do NOT use `StratifiedGroupKFold` (forbidden by Stop conditions).

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Use `StratifiedGroupKFold`.
- Use `LeaveOneGroupOut` (forbidden — per-fold variance too high).
- Pick `KFold` ignoring the group structure.
- Pass `splitter=GroupKFold()` (or any `splitter=`) to `evaluate`
  — that drops `split_kwargs` and `groups` becomes None.

---

## CASE_04 — Empty `split_kwargs` BUT possible group structure

**User prompt:**
> Wire `experiments/NN_*.py`. The data has a `region` column. Not
> sure if we should treat it as a group.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `pipeline.py` X-marker has empty `split_kwargs`.
- `status.modeling_decisions` is `locked`.
- `frame show` `translation.groups` is `region`.

**Must do:**
- **Refuse to default** to `KFold` silently.
- Route back to `build-ml-pipeline` (NOT this skill) to wire
  `split_kwargs` for `region` first.
- Cite the stop: `translation.groups` is set and `split_kwargs`
  is empty → return to `build-ml-pipeline`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Default to `KFold` and proceed.
- Auto-wire `split_kwargs={"groups": data["region"]}` from this
  skill (that's `build-ml-pipeline`'s job).
- Ask whether `region` should be a group.
- Pick `StratifiedKFold` because "stratified is safer".

---

## CASE_05 — Refuse `cross_val_score` / hand-rolled prints

**User prompt:**
> Just use `cross_val_score(learner, X, y, cv=5)` for the baseline
> evaluation and `print(mean_squared_error(...))` for the metric.
> Quick and simple.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `pipeline.py` returns a `SkrubLearner`.
- skore is installed.

**Must do:**
- Refuse `cross_val_score` and the hand-rolled metric print.
- Cite that `skore.evaluate` is the canonical entry point in this
  stack.
- Cite that `SkrubLearner` does NOT implement sklearn's
  `fit(X, y)` signature — `cross_val_score` will raise.
- Propose `skore.evaluate(learner, data={...})` with no
  `splitter=`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Write `cross_val_score(...)` in `experiments/NN_*.py`.
- Use `print(mean_squared_error(...))` instead of the report
  object.
- Allow the substitution as a "just for now" workaround.

---

## CASE_06 — CV is necessary but not sufficient for history-dep

**User prompt:**
> 02_load_forecast has lag features. CV passes clean — RMSE looks
> fine. Mark it `done` in `JOURNAL.md`.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `02_load_forecast` ran; CV report is clean.
- `tests/smoke/test_02_load_forecast.py` exists but has NOT been
  run this turn / is currently red on row-count.

**Must do:**
- Refuse to mark `done` without the smoke test passing.
- Cite the Stop condition: "CV is necessary but not sufficient for
  any pipeline with history-dependent features."
- Mention that `skore.evaluate` materializes the graph once with
  one env-dict; the smoke test exercises a fresh env-dict at
  predict time, which is what catches cold-start row drops.
- State that a passing smoke test is still required before the
  caller may flip the status.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Edit `journal/02_load_forecast.md` Status to `done`.
- Edit `journal/JOURNAL.md` History row to `done`.
- Treat clean CV as sufficient for a history-dependent pipeline.
- Write `skore.evaluate` while pytest smoke is red.

---

## CASE_07 — `skore.evaluate` / `project.put` only in experiment script

**User prompt:**
> Add a scratch probe that re-runs `skore.evaluate(learner, ...)` to
> see the updated metrics, then `project.put("02_text_encoder",
> report)` to refresh the cache.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `experiments/02_text_encoder.py` already produced a report.
- The user wants a "refreshed" version.

**Must do:**
- Refuse the scratch re-run.
- Cite the Stop condition: "`skore.evaluate(...)` and
  `project.put(...)` live only in `experiments/NN_*.py`."
- Cite that re-running from scratch lands a duplicate row under
  the same `key` in `project.summarize()`, polluting the Project's
  report index.
- Recommend using `project.summarize()` + `project.get(id)` for
  read-only inspection, OR re-running the experiment script if a
  fresh report is genuinely needed.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Approve the scratch probe with `evaluate` + `put`.
- Treat scratch as a producer of reports.

---

## CASE_08 — G-SKORE-MODE unset at first evaluate

**User prompt:**
> Wire `experiments/01_baseline.py` for the baseline.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `journal/01_baseline.md` approved.
- `src/<pkg>/pipeline.py` has `build_learner`.
- `policy.skore_mode` is unset. `import skore` may fail.
- `add-python-package` is installed.

**Must do:**
- AskUserQuestion where to store reports (local recommended /
  Hub / MLflow) before writing `skore.evaluate`.
- Persist `policy set skore_mode` after the user answers.
- If the answer is **local**, create `reports/` (`mkdir`, exist_ok)
  with no README. If **hub** or **mlflow**, do not create
  `reports/`.
- Load `add-python-package` and name
  `env add-skore --mode <mode> --execute`; do not construct the
  manager-specific requirement in this skill.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Silent-default `mode="local"` without asking.
- Drop back to `cross_val_score` because skore is missing.
- Re-ask pandas vs polars.
- Send `skore[hub]` / `skore[mlflow]` directly to pixi or conda.
- Write `reports/README.md`.

---

## CASE_09 — Recorded skore mode is not re-asked

**User prompt:**
> Wire `experiments/01_baseline.py` for the baseline.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- Same as CASE_01.
- `policy.skore_mode` is `local`.
- `skore` imports.

**Must do:**
- Use local mode; do not re-ask where to store reports.
- Pick `skore.evaluate` as the entry point.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Re-open local vs hub vs mlflow.

---

## CASE_10 — Smoke not green stops before skore.evaluate

**User prompt:**
> Wire evaluate for the 24h-ahead load forecast. Run CV now.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `journal/02_load_forecast.md` approved.
- `experiments/02_load_forecast.py` exists.
- Pipeline has lag features (history-dependent).
- `tests/smoke/test_02_load_forecast.py` is missing, or pytest is red.

**Must do:**
- Run `python -m skore_skills status`.
- STOP. Route to `build-ml-pipeline` (pytest smoke).

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Author `skore.evaluate` / `project.put` call sites this turn
  (naming them in a STOP sentence is allowed).
- Say CV can still be produced while smoke is failing.
  Explaining why CV must not run while smoke is red, including
  naming `skore.evaluate` in that STOP sentence, is allowed.

---

## CASE_11 — Direct evaluate owns convert and site build

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate the baseline.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- Same as CASE_01; smoke is green.
- `model-ml-pipeline` did NOT dispatch this turn.
- `policy.notebooks` and `policy.site` are both true.
- `export-ml-notebook` and `export-ml-site` are installed.

**Must do:**
- Write 2–6 sentences of the evaluation result.
- Name `report.html` and `html/01_baseline.html` in the
  user-facing close after site build. Do not send the user to
  the design-note markdown instead.
- Include the G-REPORT-LOCATOR value (or
  `n/a — backend did not expose a locator`) in the user-facing
  close before convert (first among tokens, after the narrative).
- Load `manage-ml-backlog` in record-outcome mode before the
  convert, since no audit ran this turn, and hand it the locator.
- Run `python -m skore_skills notebook convert
  experiments/01_baseline.py --html` after the evaluation.
- Run `python -m skore_skills site build` after the convert.
- Run `python -m skore_skills git end-turn --stage evaluate`.
- If that command returns `invoke`, load `persist-ml-git`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Convert, site-build, or `git end-turn` without the locator (or
  the explicit n/a string).
- End the turn without convert or site build while both gates are
  true. This turn has no tools, so naming `notebook convert` and
  then `site build` in that order is the close, including inside a
  later-turn list. Omitting those two names is the violation.
- Run `site build` before the journal is recorded.
- Write `journal/JOURNAL.md` or the design note directly.
- Run `git commit` in this skill.

---

## CASE_12 — Dispatched evaluate returns instead of closing

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate the baseline.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- Same as CASE_01; smoke is green.
- `model-ml-pipeline` dispatched this turn and owns the close.
- `policy.notebooks` and `policy.site` are both true.

**Must do:**
- Include the G-REPORT-LOCATOR value (or
  `n/a — backend did not expose a locator`) in the return to the
  dispatcher.
- Return to `model-ml-pipeline` after the evaluation.
- State that the dispatcher owns record-outcome / convert / site /
  `git end-turn`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Drop the locator because the dispatcher owns convert.
- Write the User-facing close (narrative + Open these) here;
  the dispatcher owns it.
- Run `notebook convert`, `site build`, or `git end-turn` here.
- Load `manage-ml-backlog` here.
- Load `triage-ml-task` directly.

---

## CASE_13 — Local put records workspace locator

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate and save 01_baseline locally.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- Smoke is green and `policy.skore_mode` is `local`.
- `project.put("01_baseline", report)` succeeds.
- The newest matching summary row has id `local-report-id`.

**Must do:**
- Read `project.summarize().frame()` after the successful put and
  select the newest matching-key row.
- Include `local workspace: [reports/](../reports/) · id:
  local-report-id` and the resolved absolute `reports/` path in
  the End of turn close (G-REPORT-LOCATOR).
- Pass that locator to audit / record-outcome.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Treat the return from `put` as the report id.
- Link an internal serialized report file.
- Announce a locator when `put` has not succeeded, or invent
  an id. Using `local-report-id` from assumed workspace state
  after a successful `put` is required, not a violation. Saying
  the live shell did not re-run `put` this turn is not a
  violation. A Pre-flight line that records that assumed locator
  source is not an announcement.
- Convert, site-build, or `git end-turn` without the locator.

---

## CASE_14 — Hub put preserves its exact report URL

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate and upload 02_encoder to Skore Hub.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- Smoke is green and `policy.skore_mode` is `hub`.
- Successful `put` stdout contains
  `Consult your report at https://hub.example/direct-report`.
- The matching report id is
  `skore:report:cross-validation:42`.

**Must do:**
- Preserve the exact stdout URL.
- Include `[Open report](https://hub.example/direct-report) · hub
  · id: skore:report:cross-validation:42` in the End of turn close
  (G-REPORT-LOCATOR).
- Pass that exact Markdown locator downstream.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Construct a Hub report URL from workspace/project/type.
- Drop the report id.
- Convert, site-build, or `git end-turn` without the locator.

---

## CASE_15 — MLflow non-HTTP locator is not a browser URL

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate 03_features into our file-backed MLflow project.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- Smoke is green and `policy.skore_mode` is `mlflow`.
- `tracking_uri` is `file:./mlruns`; put emits no run URL.
- Summary identifies experiment `7` and run `abc123`.

**Must do:**
- Include `mlflow · tracking: file:./mlruns · experiment: 7 · run:
  abc123` in the End of turn close (G-REPORT-LOCATOR).
- Pass that locator downstream.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Invent an HTTP URL for the file store.
- Treat `file:./mlruns` as a clickable run page.
- Convert, site-build, or `git end-turn` without the locator.

---

## CASE_16 — Do not pass `splitter=` when groups are on the DataOp

**User prompt:**
> Groups are already on `mark_as_X`. Call `skore.evaluate` with
> `splitter=GroupKFold()` so the gate is visible.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- X marker has `cv=GroupKFold()` and
  `split_kwargs={"groups": data["customer_id"]}`.
- Smoke is green.

**Must do:**
- Cite `references/metadata-routing.md`: omit `splitter=` so
  skore reuses DataOp `cv` and `groups`.
- Write `skore.evaluate(learner, data={...})` with no `splitter=`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Pass `splitter=GroupKFold()` (or any `splitter=`) — that drops
  `split_kwargs` and `groups` becomes None.

---

## CASE_17 — Standalone evaluate close is ordered

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate the approved, smoke-green experiment and finish the turn.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- This is a standalone evaluate invocation.
- Notebooks and site are enabled.

**Must do:**
- After `put`, write a 2–6 sentence narrative, then surface
  G-REPORT-LOCATOR first among tokens. Name `report.html` and
  `html/<stem>.html` when site build ran. Do not send the user
  to the design-note markdown instead.
- Run audit when available, then record-outcome with locator and
  optional digest/headline.
- Order the remaining close as notebook convert, site build, then
  `git end-turn --stage evaluate`.
- If git returns `invoke`, stop after loading `persist-ml-git`
  because it returns to triage.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Record before the locator exists.
- Build the site before record-outcome.
- Load triage a second time after `persist-ml-git`.

---

## CASE_18 — Direct first evaluation still requires post-smoke consent

**User prompt:**
> Run evaluation for 05_new_model.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- The design is approved and smoke is green.
- This experiment has never been evaluated.
- The user has not yet chosen Evaluate at the post-smoke gate.

**Must do:**
- Preview the possible full-dataset CV and its cost drivers, but
  state that no local evaluation starts until the gate is answered.
- Present Evaluate (Recommended) / Modify / Stop before the first
  evaluation.
- Explain that an explicit re-evaluation request for an existing
  persisted report can proceed directly.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Treat the first-run request as re-evaluation.
- Write or execute `skore.evaluate` before the gate answer.

---

## CASE_19 — F2 with beta goes through with_scoring

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate 06_classifier with an F2 score using beta=2, show it,
> and save the report.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- The post-smoke answer was Evaluate in this turn.
- The learner is a SkrubLearner. `pipeline.py` has no
  `with_scoring`.
- `python -m skore_skills api get` confirmed the installed
  `with_scoring`, `make_scorer`, and `skore.evaluate` signatures.

**Must do:**
- Load `references/custom-metrics.md`.
- Route back through build and attach
  `.skb.with_scoring(...)` before `.skb.make_learner()`, with a
  named scorer from `make_scorer(..., beta=2)`.
- After that attachment, call `skore.evaluate(learner, data={...})`
  and read the F2 row from `report.metrics.summarize().frame()`
  before `project.put(...)`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Call `report.metrics.add`.
- Pass `scoring=` to `skore.evaluate`.
- Use a lambda for the persisted scorer.

## CASE_20 — Route weighted Skrub scoring through the DataOp

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate 07_grouped with weighted MAE. Customer groups must stay
> disjoint and `sample_weight` is a column in the input table.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- The post-smoke answer was Evaluate in this turn.
- The learner is a SkrubLearner whose X marker already has
  `cv=GroupKFold()` and
  `split_kwargs={"groups": data["customer_id"]}`.
- `python -m skore_skills api get` confirmed the installed
  `with_scoring`, `make_scorer`, and `skore.evaluate` signatures.

**Must do:**
- Route back through build to derive `sample_weight` from the
  marked/aligned X DataOp and attach
  `.skb.with_scoring(..., kwargs={"sample_weight": ...})` after
  prediction and before `.skb.make_learner()`.
- Call `skore.evaluate(learner, data={...})` without
  `splitter=`.
- Read the attached name from `report.metrics.summarize().frame()`,
  then call `project.put(...)`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Call `report.metrics.add`.
- Pass `scoring=` to `skore.evaluate`.
- Put `sample_weight` in `mark_as_X(..., split_kwargs=...)`.
- Derive scoring weights from the unsplit raw frame.

## CASE_21 — Register a custom check before persistence

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate 08_wide_table and add a custom check that flags when
> the test set has more than 50 features, then save the report.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- The post-smoke answer was Evaluate in this turn.
- This is a sklearn-style estimator, not a SkrubLearner.
- `python -m skore_skills api get` confirmed the installed
  `skore.evaluate`, `skore.Check`, `CheckNotApplicable`, and
  `checks.add` signatures.

**Must do:**
- Load `references/custom-checks.md`.
- Define a named module-level `Check` subclass (not a lambda).
- Order the implementation as `skore.evaluate(...)`, then
  `report.checks.add(...)`, then
  `report.checks.summarize(...)`, then `project.put(...)`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Call `project.put` before registering the custom check.
- Replace or disable built-in SKD checks.
- Use a lambda or nested class for the persisted check.
- Register the check from `audit/` instead of
  `experiments/NN_*.py`.

## CASE_22 — Do not invent a custom check

**User prompt:**
> Wire `experiments/01_baseline.py` for the baseline. Tabular
> regression, no groups, no temporal ordering.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- `journal/01_baseline.md` approved.
- `src/<pkg>/pipeline.py` exists with `build_learner` returning a
  `SkrubLearner`. The X-marker has empty `split_kwargs`.
- Matching smoke pytest is green.
- The post-smoke answer was Evaluate in this turn.
- The user did not ask for a custom metric or custom check.

**Must do:**
- Pick `skore.evaluate(learner, data={...})` with no
  `splitter=`. The `KFold` already on the marker is reused.
- Trust skore metric and SKD-check defaults.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Define a `Check` subclass or call `report.checks.add`.
- Pass `scoring=` to `skore.evaluate`.
- Call `report.metrics.add`.

## CASE_23 — Unlocked framing does not choose a splitter

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate the baseline.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- Approved design, green smoke, declared learner.
- `status.modeling_decisions` is `draft`.
- `model-ml-pipeline` is installed.

**Must do:**
- Stop before choosing a splitter or writing `skore.evaluate`.
- Return to `model-ml-pipeline`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Ask for a cross-validator.
- Write a `skore.evaluate` call. Naming it in a STOP sentence
  is allowed.

## CASE_24 — Missing locked F2 returns to build

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate 09_classifier. The locked comparison metric is F2.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- The post-smoke answer was Evaluate in this turn.
- The learner is a SkrubLearner. `pipeline.py` has no
  `with_scoring`.
- `frame show` returned `proceed` with `translation.metric` `F2`.
- Binary classification. The X marker has `cv=KFold(n_splits=5)`.

**Must do:**
- Return to build before `skore.evaluate` so F2 is attached with
  `.skb.with_scoring(...)` before `.skb.make_learner()`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Call `skore.evaluate` while the locked scorer is missing.
- Cover the locked F2 with `report.metrics.add`.
- Pass `scoring=` to `skore.evaluate`.

---

## CASE_25 — Attached F2 is a summarize row

**User prompt:**
> Evaluate 09_classifier. The locked comparison metric is F2.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- The post-smoke answer was Evaluate in this turn.
- The learner is a SkrubLearner. The prediction DataOp already
  has `.skb.with_scoring(...)` for F2, before `make_learner`.
- `frame show` returned `proceed` with `translation.metric` `F2`.
- Binary classification. The X marker has `cv=KFold(n_splits=5)`.
- `policy.skore_mode` is `local`.

**Must do:**
- Call `skore.evaluate(learner, data={...})` without `splitter=`.
- Read the F2 row from `report.metrics.summarize().frame()`, then
  `project.put(...)`.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Send the learner back to build.
- Call `report.metrics.add`.
- Pass `scoring=` to `skore.evaluate`.

## CASE_26 — Attached metric missing because the mixin is absent

**User prompt:**
> `within_10pct` is on the learner with `with_scoring`, but
> `summarize()` has no such row. The predictor is
> `class CommuneMeanRegressor(BaseEstimator)`.

**Assumed workspace state:**
- The prediction DataOp already has
  `.skb.with_scoring(...)` for `within_10pct`, before
  `make_learner`.
- `CommuneMeanRegressor` subclasses `BaseEstimator` only.
  It implements `fit` and `predict`.
- `frame show` returned `proceed`. Tabular regression.

**Must do:**
- Return to build before treating the report as complete.
- Change the bases to `RegressorMixin, BaseEstimator`.
- The mixin is the first base.

**Must NOT do:**
- Put catalog skill ids, HITL, `G-PKG-NAME` / `G-ENV-MGR` / `G-SKORE-MODE` / `G-TABULAR` / `G-CV-SPLITTER`, or `python -m skore_skills` / `env add` in user-facing questions or the close narrative (trailing `G-REPORT-LOCATOR` / `G-AUDIT-FINDING` and unmanaged `pixi add` / `uv add` / `pip install` lines are allowed).
- Leave the class as `BaseEstimator` only.
- Write `class CommuneMeanRegressor(BaseEstimator, RegressorMixin)`.
- Call `report.metrics.add`.
- Drop `with_scoring` as if the scorer were missing.
